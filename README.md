# Coding for Everyone: C and C++

Repo with material and exercises from the 4 courses Specialization Coding for Everyone: C and C++ offered by University of California Santa Cruz.

This Specialization is intended for all programming enthusiasts, as well as beginners, computer and other scientists, and artificial intelligence enthusiasts seeking to develop their programming skills in the foundational languages of C and C++. 

Through the four courses — two in C, and two in C++ — the basics of programming in C are covered and then we move on to the more advanced C++ semantics and syntax, which will prepare you to apply these skills to a number of higher-level problems using AI algorithms and Monte Carlo evaluation in complex games.
