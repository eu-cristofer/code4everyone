# Coding for Everyone: C and C++

Repo with material and exercises from the 4 courses Specialization Coding for Everyone: C and C++, offered by University of California Santa Cruz troughout the e-learning platform [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/coding-for-everyone).

[Personal Notes](Notes.md).

## Overview

This Specialization is intended for all programming enthusiasts, as well as beginners, computer and other scientists, and artificial intelligence enthusiasts seeking to develop their programming skills in the foundational languages of C and C++. 

Through the four courses — two in C, and two in C++ — the basics of programming in C are covered and then we move on to the more advanced C++ semantics and syntax, which will prepare you to apply these skills to a number of higher-level problems using AI algorithms and Monte Carlo evaluation in complex games.

## C for Everyone: Programming Fundamentals

This course is for everyone. In the new world we live in, coding is a universally valuable skill, whether you're a scientist, artist, or a humanist. Algorithms are everywhere, and we all have to understand how they work. The C language is particularly well suited as an introduction to coding: It's a tried-and-true language, and it allows you to understand computing processes at a deep level. 

No prior knowledge of coding is needed for this course. We'll start at the beginning. The time estimated time commitment for this course is five hours a week for five weeks.

Status: Done! Check here the [certificate](https://coursera.org/share/bc976492e5e765668534fbb8928c9ead).

## C for Everyone: Structured Programming

In the new world we live in, coding is a universally valuable skill, whether you're a scientist, artist, or a humanist. Algorithms are everywhere, and we all have to understand how they work. The C language is particularly well suited as an introduction to coding: It's a tried-and-true language, and it allows you to understand computing processes at a deep level. You will also get an introduction to more advanced programming in C++ in the final module. 

This is a continuation of C for Everyone: Fundamentals, which you should take before beginning this course. 
The time estimated time commitment for this course is five hours a week for five weeks.

Status: in course.
